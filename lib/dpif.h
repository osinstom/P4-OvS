/*
 * dpif, the DataPath InterFace.
 *
 * In Open vSwitch terminology, a "datapath" is a flow-based software switch.
 * A datapath has no intelligence of its own.  Rather, it relies entirely on
 * its client to set up flows.  The datapath layer is core to the Open vSwitch
 * software switch: one could say, without much exaggeration, that everything
 * in ovs-vswitchd above dpif exists only to make the correct decisions
 * interacting with dpif.
 *
 * Typically, the client of a datapath is the software switch module in
 * "ovs-vswitchd", but other clients can be written.  The "ovs-dpctl" utility
 * is also a (simple) client.
 *
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 *
 * The terms written in quotes below are defined in later sections.
 *
 * When a datapath "port" receives a packet, it extracts the headers (the
 * "flow").  If the datapath's "flow table" contains a "flow entry" matching
 * the packet, then it executes the "actions" in the flow entry and increments
 * the flow's statistics.  If there is no matching flow entry, the datapath
 * instead appends the packet to an "upcall" queue.
 *
 *
 * Ports
 * =====
 *
 * A datapath has a set of ports that are analogous to the ports on an Ethernet
 * switch.  At the datapath level, each port has the following information
 * associated with it:
 *
 *    - A name, a short string that must be unique within the host.  This is
 *      typically a name that would be familiar to the system administrator,
 *      e.g. "eth0" or "vif1.1", but it is otherwise arbitrary.
 *
 *    - A 32-bit port number that must be unique within the datapath but is
 *      otherwise arbitrary.  The port number is the most important identifier
 *      for a port in the datapath interface.
 *
 *    - A type, a short string that identifies the kind of port.  On a Linux
 *      host, typical types are "system" (for a network device such as eth0),
 *      "internal" (for a simulated port used to connect to the TCP/IP stack),
 *      and "gre" (for a GRE tunnel).
 *
 *    - A Netlink PID for each upcall reading thread (see "Upcall Queuing and
 *      Ordering" below).
 *
 * The dpif interface has functions for adding and deleting ports.  When a
 * datapath implements these (e.g. as the Linux and netdev datapaths do), then
 * Open vSwitch's ovs-vswitchd daemon can directly control what ports are used
 * for switching.  Some datapaths might not implement them, or implement them
 * with restrictions on the types of ports that can be added or removed,
 * on systems where port membership can only be changed by some external
 * entity.
 *
 * Each datapath must have a port, sometimes called the "local port", whose
 * name is the same as the datapath itself, with port number 0.  The local port
 * cannot be deleted.
 *
 * Ports are available as "struct netdev"s.  To obtain a "struct netdev *" for
 * a port named 'name' with type 'port_type', in a datapath of type
 * 'datapath_type', call netdev_open(name, dpif_port_open_type(datapath_type,
 * port_type).  The netdev can be used to get and set important data related to
 * the port, such as:
 *
 *    - MTU (netdev_get_mtu(), netdev_set_mtu()).
 *
 *    - Ethernet address (netdev_get_etheraddr(), netdev_set_etheraddr()).
 *
 *    - Statistics such as the number of packets and bytes transmitted and
 *      received (netdev_get_stats()).
 *
 *    - Carrier status (netdev_get_carrier()).
 *
 *    - Speed (netdev_get_features()).
 *
 *    - QoS queue configuration (netdev_get_queue(), netdev_set_queue() and
 *      related functions.)
 *
 *    - Arbitrary port-specific configuration parameters (netdev_get_config(),
 *      netdev_set_config()).  An example of such a parameter is the IP
 *      endpoint for a GRE tunnel.
 *
 *
 * Flow Table
 * ==========
 *
 * The flow table is a collection of "flow entries".  Each flow entry contains:
 *
 *    - A "flow", that is, a summary of the headers in an Ethernet packet.  The
 *      flow must be unique within the flow table.  Flows are fine-grained
 *      entities that include L2, L3, and L4 headers.  A single TCP connection
 *      consists of two flows, one in each direction.
 *
 *      In Open vSwitch userspace, "struct flow" is the typical way to describe
 *      a flow, but the datapath interface uses a different data format to
 *      allow ABI forward- and backward-compatibility.  Refer to OVS_KEY_ATTR_*
 *      and "struct ovs_key_*" in include/odp-netlink.h for details.
 *      lib/odp-util.h defines several functions for working with these flows.
 *
 *    - A "mask" that, for each bit in the flow, specifies whether the datapath
 *      should consider the corresponding flow bit when deciding whether a
 *      given packet matches the flow entry.  The original datapath design did
 *      not support matching: every flow entry was exact match.  With the
 *      addition of a mask, the interface supports datapaths with a spectrum of
 *      wildcard matching capabilities, from those that only support exact
 *      matches to those that support bitwise wildcarding on the entire flow
 *      key, as well as datapaths with capabilities somewhere in between.
 *
 *      Datapaths do not provide a way to query their wildcarding capabilities,
 *      nor is it expected that the client should attempt to probe for the
 *      details of their support.  Instead, a client installs flows with masks
 *      that wildcard as many bits as acceptable.  The datapath then actually
 *      wildcards as many of those bits as it can and changes the wildcard bits
 *      that it does not support into exact match bits.  A datapath that can
 *      wildcard any bit, for example, would install the supplied mask, an
 *      exact-match only datapath would install an exact-match mask regardless
 *      of what mask the client supplied, and a datapath in the middle of the
 *      spectrum would selectively change some wildcard bits into exact match
 *      bits.
 *
 *      Regardless of the requested or installed mask, the datapath retains the
 *      original flow supplied by the client.  (It does not, for example, "zero
 *      out" the wildcarded bits.)  This allows the client to unambiguously
 *      identify the flow entry in later flow table operations.
 *
 *      The flow table does not have priorities; that is, all flow entries have
 *      equal priority.  Detecting overlapping flow entries is expensive in
 *      general, so the datapath is not required to do it.  It is primarily the
 *      client's responsibility not to install flow entries whose flow and mask
 *      combinations overlap.
 *
 *    - A list of "actions" that tell the datapath what to do with packets
 *      within a flow.  Some examples of actions are OVS_ACTION_ATTR_OUTPUT,
 *      which transmits the packet out a port, and OVS_ACTION_ATTR_SET, which
 *      modifies packet headers.  Refer to OVS_ACTION_ATTR_* and "struct
 *      ovs_action_*" in include/odp-netlink.h for details.  lib/odp-util.h
 *      defines several functions for working with datapath actions.
 *
 *      The actions list may be empty.  This indicates that nothing should be
 *      done to matching packets, that is, they should be dropped.
 *
 *      (In case you are familiar with OpenFlow, datapath actions are analogous
 *      to OpenFlow actions.)
 *
 *    - Statistics: the number of packets and bytes that the flow has
 *      processed, the last time that the flow processed a packet, and the
 *      union of all the TCP flags in packets processed by the flow.  (The
 *      latter is 0 if the flow is not a TCP flow.)
 *
 * The datapath's client manages the flow table, primarily in reaction to
 * "upcalls" (see below).
 *
 *
 * Upcalls
 * =======
 *
 * A datapath sometimes needs to notify its client that a packet was received.
 * The datapath mechanism to do this is called an "upcall".
 *
 * Upcalls are used in two situations:
 *
 *    - When a packet is received, but there is no matching flow entry in its
 *      flow table (a flow table "miss"), this causes an upcall of type
 *      DPIF_UC_MISS.  These are called "miss" upcalls.
 *
 *    - A datapath action of type OVS_ACTION_ATTR_USERSPACE causes an upcall of
 *      type DPIF_UC_ACTION.  These are called "action" upcalls.
 *
 * An upcall contains an entire packet.  There is no attempt to, e.g., copy
 * only as much of the packet as normally needed to make a forwarding decision.
 * Such an optimization is doable, but experimental prototypes showed it to be
 * of little benefit because an upcall typically contains the first packet of a
 * flow, which is usually short (e.g. a TCP SYN).  Also, the entire packet can
 * sometimes really be needed.
 *
 * After a client reads a given upcall, the datapath is finished with it, that
 * is, the datapath doesn't maintain any lingering state past that point.
 *
 * The latency from the time that a packet arrives at a port to the time that
 * it is received from dpif_recv() is critical in some benchmarks.  For
 * example, if this latency is 1 ms, then a netperf TCP_CRR test, which opens
 * and closes TCP connections one at a time as quickly as it can, cannot
 * possibly achieve more than 500 transactions per second, since every
 * connection consists of two flows with 1-ms latency to set up each one.
 *
 * To receive upcalls, a client has to enable them with dpif_recv_set().  A
 * datapath should generally support being opened multiple times (e.g. so that
 * one may run "ovs-dpctl show" or "ovs-dpctl dump-flows" while "ovs-vswitchd"
 * is also running) but need not support more than one of these clients
 * enabling upcalls at once.
 *
 *
 * Upcall Queuing and Ordering
 * ---------------------------
 *
 * The datapath's client reads upcalls one at a time by calling dpif_recv().
 * When more than one upcall is pending, the order in which the datapath
 * presents upcalls to its client is important.  The datapath's client does not
 * directly control this order, so the datapath implementer must take care
 * during design.
 *
 * The minimal behavior, suitable for initial testing of a datapath
 * implementation, is that all upcalls are appended to a single queue, which is
 * delivered to the client in order.
 *
 * The datapath should ensure that a high rate of upcalls from one particular
 * port cannot cause upcalls from other sources to be dropped or unreasonably
 * delayed.  Otherwise, one port conducting a port scan or otherwise initiating
 * high-rate traffic spanning many flows could suppress other traffic.
 * Ideally, the datapath should present upcalls from each port in a "round
 * robin" manner, to ensure fairness.
 *
 * The client has no control over "miss" upcalls and no insight into the
 * datapath's implementation, so the datapath is entirely responsible for
 * queuing and delivering them.  On the other hand, the datapath has
 * considerable freedom of implementation.  One good approach is to maintain a
 * separate queue for each port, to prevent any given port's upcalls from
 * interfering with other ports' upcalls.  If this is impractical, then another
 * reasonable choice is to maintain some fixed number of queues and assign each
 * port to one of them.  Ports assigned to the same queue can then interfere
 * with each other, but not with ports assigned to different queues.  Other
 * approaches are also possible.
 *
 * The client has some control over "action" upcalls: it can specify a 32-bit
 * "Netlink PID" as part of the action.  This terminology comes from the Linux
 * datapath implementation, which uses a protocol called Netlink in which a PID
 * designates a particular socket and the upcall data is delivered to the
 * socket's receive queue.  Generically, though, a Netlink PID identifies a
 * queue for upcalls.  The basic requirements on the datapath are:
 *
 *    - The datapath must provide a Netlink PID associated with each port.  The
 *      client can retrieve the PID with dpif_port_get_pid().
 *
 *    - The datapath must provide a "special" Netlink PID not associated with
 *      any port.  dpif_port_get_pid() also provides this PID.  (ovs-vswitchd
 *      uses this PID to queue special packets that must not be lost even if a
 *      port is otherwise busy, such as packets used for tunnel monitoring.)
 *
 * The minimal behavior of dpif_port_get_pid() and the treatment of the Netlink
 * PID in "action" upcalls is that dpif_port_get_pid() returns a constant value
 * and all upcalls are appended to a single queue.
 *
 * The preferred behavior is:
 *
 *    - Each port has a PID that identifies the queue used for "miss" upcalls
 *      on that port.  (Thus, if each port has its own queue for "miss"
 *      upcalls, then each port has a different Netlink PID.)
 *
 *    - "miss" upcalls for a given port and "action" upcalls that specify that
 *      port's Netlink PID add their upcalls to the same queue.  The upcalls
 *      are delivered to the datapath's client in the order that the packets
 *      were received, regardless of whether the upcalls are "miss" or "action"
 *      upcalls.
 *
 *    - Upcalls that specify the "special" Netlink PID are queued separately.
 *
 *
 * Packet Format
 * =============
 *
 * The datapath interface works with packets in a particular form.  This is the
 * form taken by packets received via upcalls (i.e. by dpif_recv()).  Packets
 * supplied to the datapath for processing (i.e. to dpif_execute()) also take
 * this form.
 *
 * A VLAN tag is represented by an 802.1Q header.  If the layer below the
 * datapath interface uses another representation, then the datapath interface
 * must perform conversion.
 *
 * The datapath interface requires all packets to fit within the MTU.  Some
 * operating systems internally process packets larger than MTU, with features
 * such as TSO and UFO.  When such a packet passes through the datapath
 * interface, it must be broken into multiple MTU or smaller sized packets for
 * presentation as upcalls.  (This does not happen often, because an upcall
 * typically contains the first packet of a flow, which is usually short.)
 *
 * Some operating system TCP/IP stacks maintain packets in an unchecksummed or
 * partially checksummed state until transmission.  The datapath interface
 * requires all host-generated packets to be fully checksummed (e.g. IP and TCP
 * checksums must be correct).  On such an OS, the datapath interface must fill
 * in these checksums.
 *
 * Packets passed through the datapath interface must be at least 14 bytes
 * long, that is, they must have a complete Ethernet header.  They are not
 * required to be padded to the minimum Ethernet length.
 *
 *
 * Typical Usage
 * =============
 *
 * Typically, the client of a datapath begins by configuring the datapath with
 * a set of ports.  Afterward, the client runs in a loop polling for upcalls to
 * arrive.
 *
 * For each upcall received, the client examines the enclosed packet and
 * figures out what should be done with it.  For example, if the client
 * implements a MAC-learning switch, then it searches the forwarding database
 * for the packet's destination MAC and VLAN and determines the set of ports to
 * which it should be sent.  In any case, the client composes a set of datapath
 * actions to properly dispatch the packet and then directs the datapath to
 * execute those actions on the packet (e.g. with dpif_execute()).
 *
 * Most of the time, the actions that the client executed on the packet apply
 * to every packet with the same flow.  For example, the flow includes both
 * destination MAC and VLAN ID (and much more), so this is true for the
 * MAC-learning switch example above.  In such a case, the client can also
 * direct the datapath to treat any further packets in the flow in the same
 * way, using dpif_flow_put() to add a new flow entry.
 *
 * Other tasks the client might need to perform, in addition to reacting to
 * upcalls, include:
 *
 *    - Periodically polling flow statistics, perhaps to supply to its own
 *      clients.
 *
 *    - Deleting flow entries from the datapath that haven't been used
 *      recently, to save memory.
 *
 *    - Updating flow entries whose actions should change.  For example, if a
 *      MAC learning switch learns that a MAC has moved, then it must update
 *      the actions of flow entries that sent packets to the MAC at its old
 *      location.
 *
 *    - Adding and removing ports to achieve a new configuration.
 *
 *
 * Thread-safety
 * =============
 *
 * Most of the dpif functions are fully thread-safe: they may be called from
 * any number of threads on the same or different dpif objects.  The exceptions
 * are:
 *
 *    - dpif_port_poll() and dpif_port_poll_wait() are conditionally
 *      thread-safe: they may be called from different threads only on
 *      different dpif objects.
 *
 *    - dpif_flow_dump_next() is conditionally thread-safe: It may be called
 *      from different threads with the same 'struct dpif_flow_dump', but all
 *      other parameters must be different for each thread.
 *
 *    - dpif_flow_dump_done() is conditionally thread-safe: All threads that
 *      share the same 'struct dpif_flow_dump' must have finished using it.
 *      This function must then be called exactly once for a particular
 *      dpif_flow_dump to finish the corresponding flow dump operation.
 *
 *    - Functions that operate on 'struct dpif_port_dump' are conditionally
 *      thread-safe with respect to those objects.  That is, one may dump ports
 *      from any number of threads at once, but each thread must use its own
 *      struct dpif_port_dump.

/* Flow dumping interface
 * ======================
 *
 * This interface allows iteration through all of the flows currently installed
 * in a datapath.  It is somewhat complicated by two requirements:
 *
 *    - Efficient support for dumping flows in parallel from multiple threads.
 *
 *    - Allow callers to avoid making unnecessary copies of data returned by
 *      the interface across several flows in cases where the dpif
 *      implementation has to maintain a copy of that information anyhow.
 *      (That is, allow the client visibility into any underlying batching as
 *      part of its own batching.)
 *
 *
 * Usage
 * -----
 *
 * 1. Call dpif_flow_dump_create().
 * 2. In each thread that participates in the dump (which may be just a single
 *    thread if parallelism isn't important):
 *        (a) Call dpif_flow_dump_thread_create().
 *        (b) Call dpif_flow_dump_next() repeatedly until it returns 0.
 *        (c) Call dpif_flow_dump_thread_destroy().
 * 3. Call dpif_flow_dump_destroy().
 *
 * All error reporting is deferred to the call to dpif_flow_dump_destroy().
