/* ofproto-dpif -- DPIF based ofproto implementation.
 *
 * ofproto-dpif provides an ofproto implementation for those platforms which
 * implement the netdev and dpif interface defined in netdev.h and dpif.h.  The
 * most important of which is the Linux Kernel Module (dpif-netlink), but
 * alternatives are supported such as a userspace only implementation
 * (dpif-netdev), and a dummy implementation used for unit testing.
 *
 * ofproto-dpif is divided into three major chunks.
 *
 * - ofproto-dpif.c
 *   The main ofproto-dpif module is responsible for implementing the
 *   provider interface, installing and removing datapath flows, maintaining
 *   packet statistics, running protocols (BFD, LACP, STP, etc), and
 *   configuring relevant submodules.
 *
 * - ofproto-dpif-upcall.c
 *   ofproto-dpif-upcall is responsible for retrieving upcalls from the kernel,
 *   processing miss upcalls, and handing more complex ones up to the main
 *   ofproto-dpif module.  Miss upcall processing boils down to figuring out
 *   what each packet's actions are, executing them (i.e. asking the kernel to
 *   forward it), and handing it up to ofproto-dpif to decided whether or not
 *   to install a kernel flow.
 *
 * - ofproto-dpif-xlate.c
 *   ofproto-dpif-xlate is responsible for translating OpenFlow actions into
 *   datapath actions.
